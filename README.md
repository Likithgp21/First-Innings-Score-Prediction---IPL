First Innings Score Prediction - IPL Project using Machine Learning

📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the first innings score of an IPL (Indian Premier League) match using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of historical match data, and the goal is to predict the first innings score based on factors like teams, match conditions, and previous performances.

🛠️ Technologies Used

1.	Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
2.	Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
3.	Data Processing: pandas, numpy
4.	Web Framework (if applicable): Flask (For deploying model)

💻 Model Building

In this project, I will experiment with five different algorithms to predict the first innings score, including:

Algorithms Used:

1.	Linear Regression: A simple and efficient regression model for predicting continuous values.
2.	Decision Tree Regression: A tree-based algorithm that splits data into regions and predicts based on decision rules.
3.	Random Forest Regression: An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy by averaging predictions.
4.	Boosting Algorithm:
5.	Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost): A boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak models to create a strong model.

🏆 Prediction Example

For the IPL Season 11 match (April 16, 2018):
Date: 16th April 2018
IPL Season: 11
Match Number: 13
Teams: Kolkata Knight Riders vs. Delhi Daredevils
Predicted First Innings Score: 200/9
